# Images-to-PDF
A tool for converting a folder of images to PDF format.
This is useful for when you have a comic that isn't in a document format.

To use this tool, select a directory containing those images using the Browse button or manually entering the path to the directory.
Then, enter a name for the resulting PDF file.
Click OK and the images will be compiled into a PDF.
